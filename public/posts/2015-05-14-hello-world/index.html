Welcome! This is my blog about web development, functional programming
and others geeky themes.
I am web developer, who specialised in modern web technologies, such as
Ruby on Rails, Node.js, Angular.js and others.
I love programming as great tool to solve complex real-life problems
with simplest, deadly elegant solutions.
I love programming as hard work that combines cold logic and creativity.
I love programming as endless act of self-perfection." />
