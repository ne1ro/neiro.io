Welcome! This is my blog about web development, functional programming
and others geeky themes.

I am web developer, who specialised in modern web technologies, such as
Ruby on Rails, Node.js, Angular.js and others.

I love programming as great tool to solve complex real-life problems
with simplest, deadly elegant solutions.

I love programming as hard work that combines cold logic and creativity.

I love programming as endless act of self-perfection.

This is why i would share with you my hacks, reviews, thoughts about
programming, code snippets and more interesting stuff.
